5. Select a memorable name for the Installation. Such as "Tekkit 2 Plus (1.12.2)"
6. In the **Version** drop-down menu, select the Forge version you installed.
   > If the Forge version isn't there, it is likely due to a known Launcher bug. Where the launcher doesn't actually exit when you ask it to. To fix this follow this you'll need to [close the Launcher Process](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/6662588435597-Minecraft-Launcher-Troubleshooting-FAQ-)
7. In the Game Directory field, press browse.
   > In your **.minecraft** folder we'll create a new folder where your modpack will live. This is to keep it seporate from your other installations & mods.
   > If you do not know where your **.minecraft** folder is, [follow this guide](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/.minecraft) 
   > Alternatively you could create your installation folder in another location, such as your games folder.
8. Create a folder within the desired location called "Tekkit 2 Plus" by clicking the **Make New Folder** button & press **Ok**
9. Click the **More Options** button under the **Resolution** settings.
10. Under **More Options**  in **JVM Arguments** replace "-Xmx2G" with "-Xmx4G"
    > Although the pack will run on 4GB, It is recommended to use 8GB of RAM via "-Xmx8G"
    > This may not be applicable if you do not have enough free RAM to allocate to the game.
    > You can check how much free RAM your system has by:
    > > Windows: Press **ALT+SHIFT+ESC** to open Task Manager, click **More Details** (If the performance tab is missing)  and click on the **Performance** tab. Then, click on **Memory**
    >

    > 
    > Ensure that you have enough **Available** RAM to allocate to the game.
    > If you don't, it may be because you do not have enough **Physical RAM** on your Computer - or, that you have too many memory-hungry applications open, leaving none for the game. Try closing some.
